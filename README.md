# OBD II Diagnostic Chatbot

Single Line Brief - Developing a chatbot to address and diagnose the error code from the OBD II device in the car.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a chatbot designed to interpret and diagnose error codes generated by the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD II) system in vehicles. By leveraging the OpenAI API, Falcon40B, and other large language models (LLMs), the chatbot provides real-time diagnostics, suggestions for troubleshooting, and advice for vehicle owners and technicians.

## Features
